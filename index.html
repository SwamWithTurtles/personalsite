                        <p>I've been a coding professionally at Softwire for over two years, where I now lead technical teams, with a heavy emphasis on technical mentoring and high-quality delviery of projects. I've worked mostly on web applications in a range of languages include C#, Java and Javascript.</p>
                        <p>I code a lot in my spare time, including at various hackathons. I love consuming technologies old and new, and have a particular passion for databases (given my background in Statistics).</p>
                        <p>You can often find me at conferences discussing all I've found out - there is <a href="#talks">a list of upcoming talks</a> as well as videos of my previous talks.</p>
